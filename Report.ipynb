the buisness investors and banks to invest in the economies\n\nMumbai is dubbed as the Economic capital of India and is one of the richest countries in the world.\n\nSo inorder to take this oppurtunity and develop further from it the local banks would like to invest here and prosper from it,Observe that this a win-win situtation for both the parties as it also helps in expanding their individual ventures.\n\nWe would like to analyise the Mumbai city select which areas and type of venutures are suitable for the investement.\n\n# Data:\n\nwe would want to use the Neighborhood list of mumabi :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Mumbai\n\nfoursquare API to get the venues data from requierd locations.\n\n# Methodology:\n- import necessary libraries\n- Read the neighborhood list into Pandas DataFrame\n- Get venues according to the neighborhood locations with the help of foursquare API\n- clean the data and remove any NAN values\n- correct if there are any syntactical errors\n\n# Data Analysis :\n\n- we are interested in the locations where there are more venues and diversification of venues.\n- Use pd.get_dummies() to encode the categories of restaturants\n- After using pd.get_dummies:\n\n### Our DataAnalysis is done based on two conditions:\n\n- get locations which have any category at more than 5 places\n- filter them based on variation in categories (at least it should have 2 different categories)\n\n\n\n![Data Frame with locations](1.png)\n\n- Above DataFrame shows locations which have even a single place for the category.\n- Such type of venues may come under rare categories(e.g. Amphi Theatre,Museum),as we want popular veunes we do not consider theses categories.\n- After removing categories with only one location,we are left with locations which have atleast 5 restaurants for each category.\n\n\n- But many of these locations have only one category and that is not needed because we need to have a diversified Neighborhood which has varying cuisines.\n- Filter Locations based on diversity of reataurant categories (remove if it has less than 2 different cuisines.\n\n# Final Neighborhoods:\n\n[['South Mumbai', 18],\n ['Andheri,Western Suburbs', 5],\n ['Bandra,Western Suburbs', 3]]\n\n# Plotting:\n\n- Plot the distribution of cuisines in above filtered neighborhoods.\n\n![Bar chart]\n- Bandra has equal dribution of cuisines.\n\n\nLets look at South Mumbai Distribution:\n\n![Bar chart of South Mumbai]\n\nLets look at Andheri Distribution:\n\n![Bar chart of Andheri]\n\nTop 4 Categories of South Mumbai:\n\n- Indian Restaurant\n- Cafe`\n- Fast Food Restaurant\n- Chineese\n\n\nFolium Map of every venue in South Mumbai:\n\n\n\n# KMeans Clustering :\n\n- Use SKlearn KMeans clustering Algorithm to segregate the finalised Area into clusters such that each inter cluster distance is distingushably large.\n- I have done KMeans clustering with 19 clusters(trial and error approach until all clusters have distinguishable inter cluster distance).\n- Visualize the distributions of each filtered Neighborhood with Folium Cluster Marker Plugin to get an idea of the clusters in the location\n\n- From our above data analysis we have found out that South Mumbai Area has all the below categories:\n\nAntique Shops\nArt Gallerys\nBoutiques\nBridal Shops\nCafeterias\nChaat Places\nCoffee Shops Dumpling Restaurants Goan Restaurants Harbor / Marinas History Museums Hot Springs Indian Restaurants Indoor Play Areas Lighthouses Maharashtrian Restaurants Mediterranean Restaurants Mexican Restaurants Monument / Landmarks Movie Theaters Mughlai Restaurants Parsi Restaurants Roof Decks Salon / Barbershops Seafood Restaurants Shopping Malls Soccer Fields Theaters Vegetarian / Vegan Restaurants Whisky Bars Wine Bars\nAnd Most importantly we have top 4 categories:\nTop 5 Venues in South Mumbai based on count :\n========================================\nIndian Restaurant\n====================\nCafe\n====================\nCoffee Shop\n====================\nFast Food Restaurant\n====================\nLink to Project code: Project\n\nConclusion\nSelect the location which satisfies the two mentioned conditions and select the top 5 categories of the selected top Location\n\nHere South Mumbai has very high frequency of restaurant categories and also diversified categories.\nThis can be the desired location for the banks to invest in and help the local Buisnesses.\n\n\nDiscussion:\nThe future of the project is to perform a deatailed analysis of the city with Financial data like revenue and also based on user reviews and ratings.\nWith the help of a path searching algorithm to provide an optimal path to given venue category for any given latitude and longitude in the city.\nLimitations:\nThis analysis or retrieval of venues is based purely on Foursquare API but compared to google API foursquare API lacks some venues,this is a disadvantage which can be overcome.\nAs mentioned above as the target is to provide banks for suitable investment categories and clusters we should consider other features like venue revenue ,customer satisfaction ,vicinity to cultural and tourist attractions.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name":
